    "# Week 1: Getting Started With R in Jupyter\n",
    "**Written by Professor Emily Klancher Merchant for STS 112, UC Davis, Winter 2019**\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook, which is the format we will use in STS 112 to get started with R programming. Jupyter notebooks facilitate **literate programming,** which combines chunks of natural-language text (in this case, English), with chunks of executable code (in this case, R). In this class, we will start by working with Juypyter notebooks, which have the file extension `.ipynb`. As you work through the notebooks for the class, you will notice new terms in **bold** the first time they appear. This first notebook is very abstract, as its purpose is to introduce you to the capabilities of R and Jupyter notebooks. Don't worry if it doesn't all make sense right away, and don't worry about remembering everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you find that you like working with Jupyter and want to install it on your own machine, you are in luck: Juptyter is free and open source, available as part of [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/). However, the easiest way to work with R on your own machine is to download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), both of which are also free and open source (here is a [video](https://youtu.be/EmZqlcKkJMM) I made showing the installation process on a Mac). R also has its own version of notebooks, called [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Editing\n",
    "Each chunk of either text or code is called a **block**. The first thing you need to know how to do is edit a block. You can edit this one by double-clicking anywhere in it. Once you have done that, type some text below, and then hit `shift + return` (that is, hold down `shift` and hit `return`).\n",

    "What happened when you did that? First, you saw behind the scenes of the text block above. We will discuss that in a moment. Then, you edited the block by adding your own text. Finally, you **ran** the block by clicking `shift + return`. You can also run a block of text or code by clicking the `>|Run` button above. When you were editing that block, it was outlined in green. After you ran it, this block was selected, which you can tell because it is now outlined in blue. If you want to select a block without editing it, click on it once. You can add your own text block after this one. Make sure this block is selected, then click the `+` button above. Once you have done that, choose `Markdown` from the drop-down list. You can now type any text, and then run the block."

    "## What is Markdown?\n",
    "Markdown is a simple markup language. When you edit any text block, you are editing in markdown. If you double-click in this block, you will see that I made the heading by typing two hashtags (one hashtag would give me a larger heading and three would give me a smaller one). Here is [a link to an excellent markdown resource](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which I made using square brackets and parentheses. I made *this text italic* with a single asterisk at the beginning and the end, and I made **this text bold** with two asterisks at the beginning and the end. I made `this text look like code` by typing ``` (right under the escape key in the upper left of the keyboard) at the beginning and the end. Make a new text block below and try out your own markdown. Run your block to see the final result."

    "## Getting Started With R\n",
    "As you may have noticed, when you add a new block, it defaults to code. Our notebooks have what is called an **R kernel**, so when we write code, we will be using R, which is a high-level programming language typically used for statistics and data science. R is an **interpreted language**, which means that it is **executed** one line at a time. A code block that you write in a Jupyter notebook may be a single line or a series of lines. When you run a code block, all lines in the block will be sent to the interpreter, where they will be executed one at a time. You create a code block by selecting this block, then clicking the `+` button above and making sure `Code` is selected from the dropdown list.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its simplest, R is like a large calculator. You can see this by creating a new code block below, entering a mathematical expression, and running the block. When you do that, the R interpreter will execute your code, print the results (in this case the result of evaluating the mathematical expression) to the **console** (here the space under the code block), and move on to the next block."
